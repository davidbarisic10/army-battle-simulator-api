This project demonstrates simple battle simulator between two armies. Inputs are sent via GET method in query string. 

### How to run the app?

First run:

## `npm install`

to install all the node modules, after that run:


## `npm run start`

and the app should start on port 8000.


### How to use the api?

You need to end a get request to http://localhost:8000

and send url parameters with it for example:

http://localhost:8000?army1=2200&army2=6654

You can't send anything else but integers in the query string.
